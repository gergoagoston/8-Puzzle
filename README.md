# 8-Puzzle
Solving 8 Puzzle Problem using Artificial Intelligence. I implemented the A* algorithm to solve the following problem:  The puzzle consists of 8 tiles and one empty space where the tiles can be moved. Start and Goal configurations (also called state) of the puzzle are provided. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.
